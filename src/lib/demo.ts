    title: 'Linear &lt;-&gt; Asana sync?',
    text: 'We are a software development agency and use Linear internally throughout our organization. We have a client who uses Asana and wants us to keep their Asana project up to date with the information that\'s in our Linear. That will require us to manage two systems, and the client is not willing to pay for extra management time.\n\nBefore we tell them we cannot use Asana, I wanted to see if there might be a way to sync Asana and Linear, with Linear being the "master" system to override any conflicts that might occur.\n\nZaiper or [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) might work. Has anyone used either of these? Any other options?',

But as many of you might know, it can often feel laggy, slow, and‚Ä¶ well, frustrating to use at times. So, we‚Äôre looking for something better.\n\nI‚Äôve been checking out Linear for a while. I really like how it looks, their changelog is quite active, and I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things about it‚Äîespecially from SaaS companies. It seems really impressive!\n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing: we‚Äôre a web and mobile development studio. We work with a lot of different customers and run many projects every year. I‚Äôm not sure how well Linear works for a service company like ours, and I was hoping to get some advice.\n\n- Has anyone here used Linear for managing client projects?\n- How do you organize it for multiple clients and tasks?\n- Are you happy with it for this kind of work?\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, especially if you‚Äôve faced similar challenges and found ways to make it work. \n\nThanks so much! And Merry Christmas üéÑ ',

    title: 'How to plan cooldowns?',
    text: 'Our team works in three-week cycles, followed by a one-week cooldown period. During this cooldown, we typically focus on lower-priority tasks, experimentation, or cleanup activities that didn‚Äôt quite fit into the main cycle. It‚Äôs a critical part of our workflow, giving us space to recharge, address lingering issues, and explore ideas that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise make the cut.\n\nHowever, we‚Äôve run into a frustrating limitation: it doesn‚Äôt seem possible to assign issues specifically to a cooldown. This makes tracking and planning for these periods much harder than it needs to be, and honestly, makes the feature unusable for us. Ideally, we‚Äôd love a feature that allows us to tag or assign tasks directly to cooldowns, similar to how we handle cycles.\n\nAs a workaround, we‚Äôve resorted to using four-week cycles and adding a ‚Äúcooldown‚Äù label to tasks we want to tackle during that week. While this technically gets the job done, it makes our planning process more cumbersome and less intuitive.\n\nDoes anyone else work in a similar cadence? How do you manage planning for cooldowns or off-cycle work? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions!',

    text: 'Hi guys!\n\nOur team just moved from Jira to Linear. Great UX, love it!\n\nI\'m missing a single feature: **Copying a linked issue ID**, I\'m using this a lot all over the place in docs, comments, threads, daily/weekly reports, to reference an issue.\n\nYou can "Copy ID" (`CMD + .`, no link), you can "Copy title as link" (`CMD + C`, links to the issue), but you can\'t "Copy ID as link".\n\nIn Jira I was using a hack: Right click on the issue ID in the breadcrumb at the top (this would select the entire linked issue ID, this is a MacOS system feature), ignore the contextual menu, and use `CMD + C` \\\\-&gt; this would give me an Issue ID with a link on it, that would maintain the link when posted anywhere (eg: Slack, docs, etc).\n\nIn Linear, right click won\'t select me the issue ID, it would only open the custom Linear-made contextual menu. (which is cool BTW)\n\nTemporarily, I\'m using "Copy title as link" and just deleting the issue title that\'s appended at the end, but it\'s as annoying as long the title is. :D\n\nThanks in advance, really appreciated!',
