It‚Äôs a critical part of our workflow, giving us space to recharge, address lingering issues, and explore ideas that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise make the cut.\n\nHowever, we‚Äôve run into a frustrating limitation: it doesn‚Äôt seem possible to assign issues specifically to a cooldown. This makes tracking and planning for these periods much harder than it needs to be, and honestly, makes the feature unusable for us. Ideally, we‚Äôd love a feature that allows us to tag or assign tasks directly to cooldowns, similar to how we handle cycles.\n\nAs a workaround, we‚Äôve resorted to using four-week cycles and adding a ‚Äúcooldown‚Äù label to tasks we want to tackle during that week. While this technically gets the job done, it makes our planning process more cumbersome and less intuitive.\n\nDoes anyone else work in a similar cadence?

It looks like it's not possible to move a view between those sections. \n\nI have the same dilemma within the workspace Project views - should I put my view containing my roadmap of projects inside the workspace's Projects view as a new tab at the top, or as a custom view in the workspace's Views tab? \n\n  \nAt this point I can create the same view of projects in 4 places, and I'm not sure what is best. I want to keep information as consolidated and easy to access as possible. I think it makes sense to see the list of projects inside the Projects tab, but then you lose the ability to move it between the workspace or team-specific level. Any recommendations?",

    "text": "Our workflow is pretty sprint oriented, a small software development team planning ahead for 2 weeks by using sprints (or cycles as linear prefers to call them).  \nA few days before a new cycle starts our product manager and scrum master (who is also the lead-dev), sit together and decide which issues shall be taken on during the next upcoming cycle. While testing out this workflow, it seemed like the only way to move backlog items to a cycle was by:  \n\n\n1. Going to backlog\n2. Opening a task\n3. Click ' Add to cycle '\n4. Choose cycle to which it should be added.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis requires 4 actions, repeatedly for each task. Moving 30 issues to a cycle would mean 120 clicks. This feels like there should be a much better way to achieve this. I'm used to being able to drag &amp; drop issues from my backlog to my sprint board. (which is effectly 1 slow click instead of 4 seperate clicks).  \n\n\nMy 2nd concern: I need to be in the backlog to edit issues to move them to the cycle. Meaning, I do not have an overview of what is already in the cycle and how filled up it is. If I need to play for 180 story points, I now need to either keep a headcount while filling the cycle up, or I need another browser window to keep getting back to check how much is already in there.  \n\n\nCan anyone inform me if there are better ways that I have not discovered yet to make my life with linear easier. Or should we simply stop looking at linear as an option and move on to something else.  \n",

Linear obviously isn't built with a target market of agencies, but it would be nice to retrofit it accordingly without a 'bandaid' of plugins and third parties.

All of this can surfaced by analyzing the unstructured text from these tickets.\n\nThis showcase is centered around demonstrating how we at Relevance AI actually utilized our own software to surface those insights for our team.\n\n**Dataset**\n\nCompiled from over 2000+ tickets taken from our project management system Linear. These were then exported into an CSV file and subsequently uploaded as a dataset in the Relevance AI platform, then vectorised &amp; clustered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Actionable Insights**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The highest quantity of tickets were related to the development of our Clustering product.\n   * 76 tickets total with an average completion time of 11.7 hours per ticket.\n   *  Out of 76 tickets total, only 38 tickets were completed in that month. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vqz9buyl3i81.jpg?width=1439&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1bdaa843a41fed6e0dbe222639a49256ba88414\n\n* Our fastest tickets were completed in 5.3 hours (note our team often works on tickets simultaneously). The majority of those tickets belonged to the Product team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lblywsn5m3i81.jpg?width=1448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3637e4f6c3b19f7e945b783139d8117177fb648\n\n* Our slowest tickets were related to writing vector-based content, at an average of 13.4 hours.\n* Out of 22 tickets total, only 14 have been completed in that month. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2jripl6m3i81.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=633608578cb5f89928e32a8266a51c26484b1055\n\n* If we filter the data within our dashboard by the ‚ÄúBackend‚Äù team, the most completed tickets were related to ‚ÄúChunk vector search‚Äù\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43y9zlz7m3i81.jpg?width=1429&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89f91054e2368d9246d371c7f8722c914fb1b76a\n\n**Solution**\n\n* Two apps were created very quickly, thanks to our rapid experimentation features.\n   * An app that utilizes vector embeddings from OpenAI\n   * An app that utilizes vector embeddings from SentenceTransformers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order, the steps performed were:\n\n*  Ingesting the exported csv from our project management tool\n*  Vectorizing the ticket titles\n* Clustering on the vectors created from the ticket titles, ranging from 30-120 number of clusters\n* Validating those cluster quantitatively using our Cluster Report card which looks at range of statistical scores such as Silhouette score, Dunn index, etc.\n* Validating those clusters qualitatively by viewing the distance between words using both the cluster app and our 3d projector tool.  \n\n\nThanks for reading - If you're interested to run an analysis similar to the above on your own Linear tickets, feel free to sign up to Relevance AI today - [https://auth.relevance.ai/signup?utm\\_source=reddit&amp;utm\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\_campaign=linear](https://auth.relevance.ai/signup?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=linear)",
